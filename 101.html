							Tattoos are a wonderful way to permanently adorn yourself with a message that is meaningful to you. But you must always remember the permanence of getting one.
							There are many aspects to take into account when you decide to get a tattoo as well. Spontaneous tattoos can be fun to get, but in the future you may regret permanently inking your body with something that doesn't spark joy for you.
							Some general notions to take into account when deciding to get a tattoo may include:
						</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Permanency - Do you want to live with this tattoo forever? (Or pay the price to remove it in the future?)</li>
								<li>Stigma - Some people don't take too kindly to those with tattoos, are you ready for that judgement?</li>
								<li>Meaning - Does this tattoo design have a special meaning or story?</li>
								<li>Cost - Can your wallet handle the price of getting a tattoo at this time?</li>
								<li>Pain - Are you physically prepared for the sensation of getting a tattoo?</li>
								<li>Aftercare - Are you equipped to take care of your fresh tattoo?</li>
								<li>Upkeep - Have you considered that the piece you're getting requires getting touch-ups?</li>

			<!-- 	M6LO3 Demonstrate how to create a table (HTML)
					M6LO4 Demonstrate how to span multiple rows or multiple columns in a table (HTML, document where you write HTML that causes a multi-row or multi-column span; say which one it is as well: row or column, or both)
					As demonstrated here, you can see that I took Prof G's suggestion on how to utilize a table for my website. 
					It showcases tattoo pain using gradients in the table cells as if like a bar that meters the pain threshold.
					I decided that the order of each body part listed should reflect the flow of the body.
					
					You can also see here that I utilized both the column span AND row span attributes.
					In using the rowspan attribute, because my information is displayed as a gradient, I merely clumped together some of the same data if it was the same for 2+ rows.
					For example, Elbows, Inner Elbows, Inner Arms, Wrists, and Hands & Fingers all fall under the Most Discomfort classification of tattoo pain. Therefore, starting at the Elbow table header, I gave the table data a rowspan of 5.
					Meaning that not only would the data fall under Elbow, but it would for the other 4 table headers as well (Inner Elbow, Inner Arm, Wrist, Hands & Fingers).
					
					I used the colspan attribute very similarly to rowspan. Instead of spanning the information down a row, I used it to span over multiple columns.
					For example, according to my table Shoulder Blades fall under the Some Discomfort classification of tattoo pain. I created it this way by making a table data span 2 columns, filled up with my allocated linear gradient for that classification.
					I created an empty cell of table data to make sure that that extra column was filled up for that table header. 
					
					These demonstrations of colspan and rowspan are used in many other cases within the table as well.

						<h4 class="subtext">The Risks</h4>
							<p class="subtext">
								When getting a tattoo, you are allowing a stranger to pierce through the epidermal and dermal layers of your skin, so that they may 
								fill the skin with ink. Because of this, your body reacts to getting a tattoo as if it were an open wound, therefore you must treat it as such. It is important to care for your tattoo, especially when fresh, to reduce
								any possibility of an infection or complication.
							</p>	
					</div>
					<div class="col-1-3">
						<h4 class="subtext">Choosing a Tattoo</h4>
							<p class="subtext">
								There are many different reasons why a person might get a tattoo. Nowadays it's more common for people to get spontaneous tattoos. But it's okay to take time to choose something meaningful for you.
								Many people get tattoos in the memory of a loved one, perhaps an inspirational quote or symbol. It can be as abstract as you can imagine. What matters is that it means something to you.
							</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-1-3">
						<h4 class="subtext">Tattoo Placement</h4>
							<p class="subtext">
								Another important step to preparing yourself for getting a tattoo is to think about where you might get it. Depending on things such as your job, your family's perception of tattoos,
								or even the design itself, it may benefit you to place it in a place that's easier to conceal. 
								<br><br>Likewise, maybe you want it to really stand out and be noticeable no matter what you're wearing.
								Regardless, it's crucial to take into account that the area you get tattooed is also unique in it's pain level, and that nobody experiences tattoo pain quite the same way. Your tattoo artist may have some great
								suggestions about where to place your tattoo as well.
							</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-1-3">
						<h4 class="subtext">Finding a Tattoo Shop</h4>
							<p class="subtext">
								A significant step to getting a quality tattoo - that can be easily overlooked - is picking out a good tattoo shop. Most tattoo shops have a two-step fee. 
								First is the downpayment. In a place like Seattle it's normal for a downpayment to be around $60-$100 depending on the shop and artist. The downpayment covers the first hour of your appointment.
								Then the artist will charge you by the hour. This price range greatly varies, and often times the more experienced and in-demand the artist is, the higher the price. But it is worth it.
								<br><br>It's easy to be swayed by shops with lower fees and downpayments, but that often (not always) can leave you with less than ideal results. Take your time to research tattoo shops in your area, or even cities nearby you.
								Look for the reviews and ratings online, check out the artists' portfolio on the shop's website, and find an artist whose style suits the design you want.

						<h4 class="subtext">Touch-Ups</h4>
							<p class="subtext">
								Some tattoos require touch ups. This means that after an extended period of time, you'll need to invest money into another tattoo session for an artist to fill your skin back up with ink.
								This isn't a required step to getting a tattoo, but as far as tattoo management goes, it can keep your tattoo looking fresh.
								<br><br>Sometimes your tattoo artist may move far away and leave you wondering how your tattoo will fare being touched up by somebody that didn't do the tattoo.
								But do not worry, just as you may have when you initially got the tattoo, invest yourself in finding a reputable artist. There may even be an artist at the shop you previously went to who will be up to the task.
							</p>
					</div>
						<div class="col-1-4">
							<h4 class="subtext">Cover-Ups</h4>
								<p class="subtext">
									As the years pass by (or sooner if you get a tattoo that you really regret) it is an option to get a tattoo cover-up. This means that you can commission an artist to create a design with you that will work 
									with the flow of your pre-existing tattoo and cover it with a design that makes you happier. 
									<br><br>This is a good way to "remove" a tattoo that you no longer agree with, yet maintain a tattoo. And while it's still overall
									expensive to get a tattoo (and takes much more effort and creativity to find a design to cover one up), it is way less painful and more cost-effective than simply removing one.
								</p>
						</div>
					<div class="col-1-4">
						<h4 class="subtext">Infections</h4>
							<p class="subtext">
								It is normal to experience skin irritation right after getting a tattoo. After all, you did just open up a (very pretty) large "wound" in your skin. Give yourself a few days to recuperate, if you feel you are getting worse
								rather than better these are the signs to watch out for: feeling feverish, shivering, tattoo swelling, pus and ooze coming from the tattoo, visibly damaged skin tissue. 
								<br><br>It is important to contact your doctor no matter what if you are still feeling unwell a several days after getting a tattoo. There are different forms of bacteria or viruses that can cause a tattoo infection
								so your doctor will likely need to run a few tests. 
								<br><br>Hopefully all that you'll need is a simple antibiotic, at its worst you may need treatment for months. The risk of infection is another good reason to take that extra time
								and spend that extra coin for a well-reputable tattoo artist.
