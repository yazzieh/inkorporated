							Tattooing has been practiced across the globe since at least Neolithic times, as evidenced by mummified preserved skin, ancient art and the archaeological record. Both ancient art and archaeological finds of possible tattoo tools suggest tattooing was practiced by the Upper Paleolithic period in Europe. 
							However, direct evidence for tattooing on mummified human skin extends only to the 4th millennium BC. The oldest discovery of tattooed human skin to date is found on the body of Ötzi the Iceman, dating to between 3370 and 3100 BC. Other tattooed mummies have been recovered from at least 49 archaeological sites, 
							including locations in Greenland, Alaska, Siberia, Mongolia, western China, Egypt, Sudan, the Philippines and the Andes.

					Since the 1970s, tattoos have become a mainstream part of global and Western fashion, common among both sexes, to all economic classes, and to age groups from the later teen years to middle age. For many young Americans, the tattoo has taken on a decidedly different meaning than for previous generations. 
					The tattoo has "undergone dramatic redefinition" and has shifted from a form of deviance to an acceptable form of expression.
					<br><br>In 1988, scholar Arnold Rubin created a collection of works regarding the history of tattoo cultures, publishing them as the "Marks of Civilization". 
					In this, the term "Tattoo Renaissance" was coined, referring to a period marked by technological, artistic and social change. Wearers of tattoos, as members of the counterculture began to display their body art as signs of resistance to the values of the white, heterosexual, middle-class.
					The clientele changed from sailors, bikers, and gang members to the middle and upper class. There was also a shift in iconography from the badge-like images based on repetitive pre-made designs known as flash to customized full-body tattoo influenced by Polynesian and Japanese tattoo art, known as sleeves, which are categorized under the relatively new and popular avant-garde genre.
					Tattooers transformed into "Tattoo Artists": men and women with fine art backgrounds began to enter the profession alongside the older, traditional tattooists.

					Irezumi (入れ墨, lit. "inserting ink") are traditional Japanese tattoos. Irezumi is the Japanese word for tattoo, and Japanese tattooing has had its own distinct style created over centuries. 
					Irezumi is done by hand, using wooden handles and metal needles attached via silk thread. This method also requires special ink called Nara ink (zumi). It is a painful and time consuming process, done by a limited number of specialists. 
					<br><br>The tattoo artist is called a Brother, and usually has one or more apprentices working for him for a long period of time. They often become a part of the horishis tattoo family. Irezumi was initially associated with firemen, who wore them as a form of spiritual protection. 
					They were admired figures of bravery and roguish sex-appeal, which inspired imitation. At the beginning of the Meiji period the Japanese government outlawed tattoos, and Irezumi took on connotations of criminality. 
					Many yakuza and other criminals now avoid tattoos for this very reason. <br><span class="small">Read More <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irezumi">Here</a></span>

					The Pe'a is the popular name of the traditional male tatau (tattoo) of Samoa, also known as the malofie, a term used in the Samoan language chiefly vocabulary and "respect" register (gagana fa'aaloalo).
					The soigaimiti/pe'a covers the body from waist to the knees. The word tattoo in the English language is believed to have originated from the Samoan word "tatau".
					The tatau process for the pe'a is extremely painful,and undertaken by tufuga ta tatau (master tattooists), using a set of handmade tools: pieces of bone, turtle shell and wood. 
					The tufuga ta tatau are revered masters in Samoan society. 
					<br><br>In Samoan custom, a pe'a is only done the traditional way, with aspects of cultural ceremony and ritual, and has a strong meaning for the one who receives it. 
					The tufuga ta tatau works with one or two assistants, often apprentice tattooists, who stretch the skin and wipe the excess ink and generally support the tattooist in their work. 
					The process takes place with the spanject lying on mats on the floor with the tattooist and assistants beside them. The assistants to the tattooists are referred to as the solo, a Samoan word describing the act of wiping the blood off the skin. 
					Family members of the person getting the tattoo are often in attendance at a respectful distance to provide words of encouragement, sometimes through song. The pe'a can take less than a week to complete, or, in some cases, years.

					Old school (tattoo) refers to a Western or traditional American tattoo style featuring bold black outlines and a limited color palette. 
					This limited color palette typically included yellow, red, green and black. Purple was eventually added to it as well.
					<br><br>Examples of popular old school tattoo designs include: 
					<br><br>Native American tattoos, Pin-up tattoos, Mermaid tattoos, Swallow and sparrow tattoos, Heart tattoos, Anchor tattoos, Eagle tattoos, Navy and other armed forces symbols, Dagger tattoos, Rose tattoos, Gypsys.
					<br><br>Often times, these tattoos had significance behind them for those in the Armed Forces. For instance, getting a tattoo of an anchor represented "stability".

					New school is a tattooing style originating as early as the 1970s and influenced by some features of old school tattooing in the United States. 
					The style is often characterized by the use of heavy outlines, vivid colors, and exaggerated depictions of the spanject. New school also represents a transition towards openness in the sharing of techniques in tattooing.
					New school tattooing incorporates elements from many tattooing traditions including irezumi, old school, and folk art. It is similar to old school tattooing in that they both generally employ heavy outlines.
					In contrast to the restricted palette in old school, however, new school tattoos frequently use a range of bright colors. 
					<br><br>New school tattoos are not realistic in that they exaggerate details in the spanject;
					they are sometimes compared to styles seen in cartooning, graffiti art, and themes seen in hip hop culture such as jagged edges and bubble letters.
					In terms of spanject matter, new school tattoos are not restricted to traditional spanjects (such as hearts and eagles). They feature fantastical spanjects, novel patterns, and generally allow for a great deal of customization.
					However, old school spanjects are commonly done in a new school style as a way of expressing homage or irony.
