This is my CIS155 readme for my repo. 
My project is about Tattoos.

CIS 155 is the Web Development class that the creator of this website (Yazmine Hoelscher) is taking in the Winter Quarter of 2019 at Olympic College (Bremerton, WA) with Professor Garripoli. 
The final project of the class will be a website that showcases the HTML5 and CSS3 skills learned throughout the course.
